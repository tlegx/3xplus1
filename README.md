# 3xplus1
3x+1 (or as known as the "Collatz conjecture") is a conjecture in mathematics which left an unsolved problem, making mathematicians scratching their heads for years. This program will automatically apply numbers to this conjecture and return results.
You can see more of this in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
## Using the program
Make sure you have installed the ***[Python interpreter](https://python.org)***, ***[Python "Readchar" library](https://pypi.org/project/readchar)*** before continuing.
Navigate to the directory you've downloaded this and type
```
python main.py
```
in a terminal or you can simply double-click to run it. Follow the instruction to begin.
***Notice:*** to prevent an indefinite "4, 2, 1" loop, a check had been added and exits from the loop after 5 times.
## Increasing the interval
By default, the interval between each math operations is ***0.5 seconds***. Since the code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tlegx/3xplus1/blob/master/LICENSE), you are free to change this value (and other bits of the code too, without permission!) to whatever you'd like.
***Important:*** I will work on a more easy way to customize this without touching the code (like adding a config file). This feature may be released in the next version.
## Bugs and Contributions
I am improving this project since there might be some bugs and unintended behavior. As always, I'm currently seeking for contributions. If you found a bug, open an [issue](https://github.com/tlegx/3xplus1/issues) or look for ways to contact me on my [GitHub README](https://github.com/tlegx)
